            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>

            <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The NBA has a vast fan base seeking platforms to express opinions, connect with other enthusiasts, and stay updated with their favorite teams and players. However, there is a lack of centralized and interactive platforms that cater to these needs comprehensively.
            </p>

            <h3>Identify Information Technology Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The primary information technology problem is the absence of a user-centric, interactive platform for NBA fans. Existing solutions like the NBA's official app and Reddit's NBA subreddit offer partial solutions but lack personalization and interactive elements that enhance fan engagement.
            </p>

            <h3>Identify Existing Attempts</h3>
            <section>
                <h4><a href="https://www.nba.com/">NBA's Official App</a></h4>
                <p>
                    Provides news, scores, and video highlights but lacks interactive features like fan forums and prediction tracking.
                </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/?rdt=35170">Reddit's NBA Subreddit</a></h4>
                <p>
                    Offers a platform for discussion but lacks personalization and official integration with NBA data.

            <h3>How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem?</h3>
            <p>
                In many sports, a hub of information is a crucial part of sports discussion. Meaningful sports discussions are not only built on a common 
                home of information, but a centralized homr that many people can look to when discussing anything sports related. Right now, there is 
                no centralized hub that serves as this domain for nba fans. This app can provide a community where nba fans can congregate and talk about
                anything nba.
